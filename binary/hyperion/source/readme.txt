# DESCRIPTION                                                                 #
# Hyperion is a runtime encrypter for 32/64 bit portable executables. It is a #
# reference implementation and bases on the paper "Hyperion: Implementation   #
# of a PE-Crypter". The paper describes the implementation details which      #
# aren't in the scope of this readme file.                                    #
# The crypter is a C project and can be compiled with the corresponding       #
# makefile (tested with Mingw and Visual Studio). Afterwards it is started    #
# via the command line and encrypts an input executable with AES-128. The     #
# encrypted file decrypts itself on startup (bruteforcing the AES key which   #
# may take a few seconds) and generates a log file for debug purpose.         #
#                                                                             #
# TODO                                                                        #
# - AES payload: Maybe use Windows crypto API instead because our fasm aes    #
#   payload is full of static tables                                          #
# - Better crypto blob hiding/obfuscation                                     #
# - Dynamically morph code and add junk code                                  #
# - Support late Binding of DLLs/APIs                                         #
# - Check for correct DLL Version Numbers before Loading                      #
# - Analysis: What else is missing in PE loader                               #
# - Provide hyperion as free a web service to hide advanced implementation    #

# - each function uses shadow registers -> preparation for code morphing      #
# - basic win32 apis are part of import table and not loaded dynamically      #

# - aes payload uses new FasmAES 1.3 which has several bugfixes               # 
#                                                                             #
